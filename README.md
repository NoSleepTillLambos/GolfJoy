### Project Description

<h5>This project was built using Xcode and programmed using Swift. The app features a variety of videos that golfers can access to help improve and work on all aspects of their game.</h5>

### Built With

* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
* [Swift](https://www.swift.org/)
* [SF Symbol](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
<!-- Make sure to add appropriate information about what prerequesite technologies the user would need and also the steps to install your project on their own mashines -->
## Getting Started

The following instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the latest version of [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) installed on your machine.
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->
I tried to keep the app as simple yet compelling as possible, with the user flow at the top of the priority list ensuring easy access to everything with 
very few clicks of a button

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

<h5> The development consisted of testing a wide variety of IOS apps on my own phone to get a look and feel for the space and what i would want from an app, from there i created the wireframes, collected inspiration and began developing the app </5>

#### Highlights
<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->
- Learning Swift and some of the Xcode ecosystem was definately the biggest upside of the project, it's a booming market and something I am extremely happy working with
- Hopefully i'll get a few more projects like these so i can focus on my skills and become a better ios developer

#### Challenges
- Learning an entirely new syntax proved to be difficult
- Xcode is very finicky so getting around those and working out the correct methods and paths was a problem for me in the beginning, lucky there are some very well put together tutorials that helped me get past a lot of the problems


<!-- MOCKUPS -->
## Final Outcome

### Mockups

#### Future Implementation

In the future i would like to include a external storage system such as firebase and begin storing some users information and stats <br/>
Including a system where users can log their scores and keep track of their handicaps, at the moment you need an app thats either paid to maintain an accurate score.
