### Project Description

<h5>This project was built using Xcode and programmed using Swift. The app features a variety of videos that golfers can access to help improve and work on all aspects of their game during their round or at the range, making it mobile and easy to access.</h5>

### Built With

* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
* [Swift](https://www.swift.org/)
* [SF Symbol](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
<!-- Make sure to add appropriate information about what prerequesite technologies the user would need and also the steps to install your project on their own mashines -->
## Getting Started

The following instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the latest version of [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) installed on your machine.
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->
I tried to keep the app as simple yet compelling as possible, with the user flow at the top of the priority list ensuring easy access to everything with 
very few clicks of a button
### Wireframes

### User-flow

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

<h5> The development consisted of testing a wide variety of IOS apps on my own phone to get a look and feel for the space and what i would want from an app, from there i created the wireframes, collected inspiration, and began developing the app</5>

#### Highlights
<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->
- Swift actually proved to great to work with, SF symbols provided me with numerous options which i had on hand at all times and simply needed to reference them with no imports required. 
- Working with data and accessing it through the app to make it dynamic, I was just very excited to work with IOS in general, it's obviously such a big part of our world today so getting a feel for it was a real blessing in my development career 

#### Challenges
- My biggest challenge initially was getting used to the syntax and the order of things within Xcode, unlike other languages it has to be perfect for the previews and simulator to run, in a way i find it very useful because your problem is presented to you immediately.


<!-- MOCKUPS -->
## Final Outcome

### Mockups

<br/>


#### Future Implementation

In the future i would like to include a external storage system such as firebase and begin storing some users information and stats <br/>
Including a system where users can log their scores and keep track of their handicaps, at the moment you need an app thats either paid to maintain an accurate score or you require a membership at a certain club
